# Kidney-Transplant-Scheduler
This is the course project of ZJU's Operational Research and System Engineering implemented by 10th group. Our work is dedicated to solve the inter-transplant problem.

The repo consists of a simulated data generator, an implementation of blossom algorithm and a collection of algorithms for both circle and chain exchange task.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install necessary packages to your python environment
3. Change to KindeyExchageDataGenerator, open kindey_exchage_data.py with editor, follow the annotations to modify the specifications and run
4. Run graph_match.py and you will get the simulated dataset for kidnet transplant
5. Read the explanation in kidney_solver and Blossom, using the simulated dataset to test the solvers
